## Programming Paradigm
* A programming paradigm is simply a style of programming. Each paradigm varies depending on the specific needs of the programmer.
### Classification of programing paradigms
## Declarative
* **Functional:** (also, Applicative) Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.

* **Data flow:** (flow driven) Programming with emitters and listeners of asynchronous actions.

* **Logic, Constraint-based:** (rule-based) Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules. An engine infers the answers to questions.

* **Template-based:** Programming where templates are used by a compiler to generate temporary source code, which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled

* **Structured:** programming with clean, nested control structures rather than via gotos.

## Imperative
* **Von Neuman:** is any of the programming languages that are high-level abstract isomorphic copies of von Neumann architectures.
* **Interpreted(Scripting):** intended to be very fast to learn and write in, either as short source code files or interactively in a read–eval–print loop (REPL, language shell)
* **Object-Oriented:** Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other. Objects own their own internal state and public interfaces. Object Orientation can be: class-bassed or prototype based.

## Implementation methods of the programming paradigms:

There are two main ways that languages can be implemented:

    • A language can be interpreted 
    • A language can be compiled


Recognize programming languages
Recognize sequential algorithms
Define the concept of source code

### Describe concept and characteristics of data representatoin in structured programming language:
* *Identifiers*
* *Variables*
* *Constants* 
* *Reserved Words*

## Type of data 
A data type is a type together with a collection of operations 
to manipulate the type

#### **Data primitives:** 
 They are simple values, manipulated with operations
 provided directlythey are simple values, manipulated 
 with operations provided directly by the programming language 
 and can normally be represented and manipulated with the tools 
  available in the computer's machine language
   Common examples of primitve data types: 
	* Boolean
	* Character 
	* Double
	* Integer
	* Long
	* Short
	* String
	* Void 


#### **Data composite:** 
They are data types whose values consist of collections
 of data elements also made up of previously definitive data types.Like: 
	* Arrays 
	* Tables 
	* String
 ### Memory and range space for each data type 
|Data type|Storage| Range |
| -- | -- | -- |
|char      |8 bytes|- 128 to 127|
|INT     |2 byte |  -32768 a 32767  |
| float   |4 bytes| 3.4E-38 a 3.4E+38  |
|DOUBLE	  |8 bytes| 1.7E +/- 308 (15 digits)|
|-- | -- | -- |

*The memory of each datype can be change depeds what is that variable and 
the range it is same.*  
 
### Data type conversion 
Is basically converting one type of data type to other to perform some operation. 
 The conversion is done only between those datatypes wherein the conversion is possible ex – char to int and vice versa.
* **Implicit:** is usually performed by the compiler
	 when necessary without any commands by the user.
* **Explicit:** conversion rules out the use of compiler 
	for converting one data type to another instead the user 
	explicitly defines within the program
### Identify the operators of structured programming language: 

* **Conditional:** are used to evaluate a condition that's applied 
	to one or two boolean expressions

* **Logical:** is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions 
	like that the value of the compound expression produced depends only on
	that of the original expressions and on the meaning of the operator. 
 *operators in **C***
 
 |  && | AND  |
 | -- | -- | 
 | || | OR |
 | !  | NOT|
 
* **Ralational:** is a programming language construct or operator that tests or defines some kind of relation between two entities.
